### 1. Create an Order (i.e. Terrific Taco Truck)

Orders should be used to organize ads by group or company.

### 2. Create a Line Item (i.e. December Taco Bonanza)

A Line Item is effectively the unit for an advertisement.

### 3. Attach One or More Creatives (i.e. TacoDecember_Mobile, TacoDecember_Desktop, TacoDecember_Desktop_Alt)

Attach creatives to the Line Item.

### 4. Create an Ad Unit if one doesn't already exist (i.e. Leaderboard)

The Ad Unit should support all creative sizes on a Line Item. Ex: 320x50 and 728x90.

### 5. Create Placements

Placements are unique locations on your website. As you create and edit placements, point them at appropriate ad units.
