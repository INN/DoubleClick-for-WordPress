### Terms
##### Advertisement-specific
* __Order__ - Found under __Delivery__, an Order contains line items.
* __Line Item__ - Found under __Delivery__, Line Items are attached to Orders and contain multiple Creatives.
* __Creatives__ - Creatives are images or animated banners attached to __Line Items__. They are a fixed pixel measure (i.e. the Mobile Leaderboard ad unit size is 320x50). Multiple identical creatives might be needed of a single advert to accomplish responsive sizing.

##### Site-speficic
* __Ad Units__ - Found under Inventory, Ad Units target multiple creative sizes.
* __Placements__ - Found under Inventory, Placements may target Ad Units.

### 1. Create an Order (i.e. Terrific Taco Truck)

Orders should be used to organize ads by group or company.

### 2. Create a Line Item (i.e. December Taco Bonanza)

A Line Item is effectively the unit for an advertisement.

### 3. Attach One or More Creatives (i.e. TacoDecember_Mobile, TacoDecember_Desktop, TacoDecember_Desktop_Alt)

Attach creatives to the Line Item.

### 4. Create an Ad Unit if one doesn't already exist (i.e. Leaderboard)

The Ad Unit should support all creative sizes on a Line Item. Ex: 320x50 and 728x90.

### 5. Create Placements (i.e. Global_Header_Banner or Article_Rail1)

Placements are unique locations on your website. As you create and edit placements, point them at appropriate ad units.
