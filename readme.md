# Super Cool Ad Manager Plugin

Serve DoubleClick ads natively in WordPress. Built to make serving responsive ads easy.

[Read the documentation on GitHub](https://github.com/INN/DoubleClick-for-WordPress/tree/master/docs).

This plugin was named "DoubleClick for WordPress" [until](https://github.com/inn/doubleclick-for-wp/issues/69) Google [renamed DoubleClick for Publishers to Google Ad Manager](https://www.blog.google/products/admanager/introducing-google-ad-manager/). That's why this GitHub repo is named `INN/doubleclick-for-wp`.
