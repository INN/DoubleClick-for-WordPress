== Changelog ==

= 0.3 =

Thanks to WordPress.org user [onlineforbusiness](https://wordpress.org/support/users/onlineforbusiness/) and GitHub users [dbeniaminov](https://github.com/dbeniaminov) and [tienvooracht](https://github.com/tienvooracht) for their contributions to this release.

New features:

- Adds a Gutenberg Block for manual insertion of ads in posts. [Pull request #82](https://github.com/INN/doubleclick-for-wp/pull/82) for [issue #70](https://github.com/INN/doubleclick-for-wp/issues/70).
- Adds a PHP filter `'dfw_js_data'`, to allow modification of the `window.dfw` object before it's output on the page. Refactors widgets and blocks to draw all details needed from `window.dfw` instead of separately-enqueued JSON blobs. This should allow you to `setRequestNonPersonalizedAds. [PR #81](https://github.com/INN/doubleclick-for-wp/pull/81) for [issue #63](https://github.com/INN/doubleclick-for-wp/issues/63), with thanks to GitHub user [tienvooracht](https://github.com/tienvooracht) for the idea.

Changes and fixes:

- Rebrands from "DoubleClick for WordPress" to "Super Cool Ad Manager Plugin", because [Google merged DoubleClick for Publishers into Google Ad Manager](https://www.blog.google/products/admanager/introducing-google-ad-manager/).
- Updates to `jquery.dfp.js` version 2.4.2, adding `setCentering` support. [PR #67](https://github.com/INN/doubleclick-for-wp/pull/67) for [issue #66](https://github.com/INN/doubleclick-for-wp/issues/66)
- Adds "Category" targeting on category archive. [PR #72](https://github.com/INN/doubleclick-for-wp/pull/72) for [issue #61](https://github.com/INN/doubleclick-for-wp/issues/61).
- Adds "Tag" targeting on tag archive. [PR #74](https://github.com/INN/doubleclick-for-wp/pull/74) for [issue #29](https://github.com/INN/doubleclick-for-wp/issues/29).
- Fixes a number of PHP warnings and errors, including [issue #8](https://github.com/INN/doubleclick-for-wp/issues/8) and [issue #37](https://github.com/INN/doubleclick-for-wp/issues/37) in [PR #76](https://github.com/INN/doubleclick-for-wp/pull/76) and [issue #31](https://github.com/INN/doubleclick-for-wp/issues/31) in [PR #80](https://github.com/INN/doubleclick-for-wp/pull/80/).

Documentation updates:

- Moves the documentation index file from `docs/index.md` to `docs/readme.md` in the GitHub repository, so that the Markdown will display to all who visit [the docs directory](https://github.com/INN/doubleclick-for-wp/tree/master/docs). ([PR #80](https://github.com/INN/doubleclick-for-wp/pull/80))
- Moves plugin functions and files around within the plugin; see [PR #72](https://github.com/INN/doubleclick-for-wp/pull/81) for details.
